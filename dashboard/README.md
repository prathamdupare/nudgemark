# Next.js + Appwrite + Auth + ShadCN UI

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).  
It provides a boilerplate setup integrating **Appwrite** for backend services, **NextAuth** for authentication, and **ShadCN UI** for a sleek and customizable user interface.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Full-stack React framework.
- **Appwrite**: Backend for authentication, database, and more.
- **NextAuth**: Easy and extensible authentication.
- **ShadCN UI**: Pre-styled UI components for faster development.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Setup environment variables

Copy the example `.env` file to `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in the required values in `.env.local`.

### 3. Install dependencies

Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 4. Run the development server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
